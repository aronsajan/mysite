      I am the founder and maintainer of the open source project *Handy-Messaging-Framework*. It is a framework that abstracts the messaging layer from your application. It abstracts the details of how to interface with different messaging systems like Apache Kafka, Google Pubsub, MQTT etc… It offers different features like:
      - Portability between different messaging systems
      - Interoperability with different messaging systems
      - Standardized Messaging Data Types
      - Handling message ordering to avoid race condition
      - Seamless testing of application
